This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

# This is a work in Progress :)

# There are still a number of major issues that need to be fixed including:

* Animation once the progress bar passes by the 0 degree mark; there is a current glitch in the Animation that needs to be solved.
* Will need to figure out how to limit users from sliding past the '12 o'clock' point from either direction, so that they can choose 0 or 100.
